# Snap To Layer for WinForms

### Description

This project shows how you can apply snapping to an EditInteractiveOverlay. There are many aspects to snapping. Previously, we showed a project with the mouse pointer snapping to the closest vertex of an editable polygon. Today, we show the technique to drag a control point and have it snap to the closest vertex of a layer if within tolerance. The tolerance can be set in world (meter, feet etc) or screen (pixels) coordinates. Notice that we are also using the technique showed in the previous project “Dragged Point Style”.
